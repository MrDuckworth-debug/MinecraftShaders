This is me making a shader for the first time,  here is the description of my issues:
I am following a shader tutorial to code my own shader and stumbled across an issue where my clouds/entities/players look unloaded or cut out. This is the tutorial I am using and I noticed the issue around the transparency section found around the 18 minute mark. He does not have the issue but I do.
I have followed everything he has done and went up to the sky step where the sky and stars are fixed but i still have this issue.
